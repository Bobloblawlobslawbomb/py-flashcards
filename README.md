## Description

_This program uses csv files to generate a list of objects representing flashcards to the user. After 3 seconds the english translation of the word will appear and the user may click the 'checkmark' button if they knew the words meaning or click the 'red x' if they were unsure of the words definition. The 'checkmark' will remove the item from the list of card objects. A file named 'french-words-to-learn' will be generated out of the remaining list items._
